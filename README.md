Fixing the Markup of Tables
---------------------------
- Here's a file containing every poorly formatted table in the code: http://razor.occams.info/files/dc_code_tables.html
- We want to replace each with proper HTML tables. A skeleton HTML table is listed after each one, so you can download this file and edit it to put the new HTML tables in.
- You can preview the tables by plugging them in our editor demo. But please also record the HTML in a file that you can email to Dave or Josh after so we don't lose it. http://esq.io:8000/patch/TestingNiceHTMLTables MR: I'm creating a repo here: https://github.com/mroswell/dccode-simple-tables
- Compare to https://law.resource.org/pub/us/code/dc/ (there may be newer files)
